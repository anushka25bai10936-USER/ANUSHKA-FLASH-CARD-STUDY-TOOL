PROJECT DESCRIPTION:: 
Often, going through a chapter while studying feels too boring and a tiresome task.To make it engaging and productive flash card note taking with 5 step study method is actually a good solution. The Flashcard Study Tool is an interactive is a study assistant designed to help students learn more effectively. It combines self made or customised flashcards, self-testing, automated accuracy tracking, and a 5-step study method : Survey,Question,Read,Recite and Review The program allows users to input their own study material, test themselves, redo incorrect answers, and visualize their performance using graphs or histograms . It also includes randomized flashcard ordering and accuracy statistics using Python’s built-in modules.

FEATURES:: 
FlashCard MODE :

Create your own set of flashcards Randomized question order using the RANDOM MODULE . Self-evaluation: Mark each answer as CORRECT OR INCORRECT.

CHOICE to retry or Redo the questions you got INCORRECT.

Automatic scoring and feedback.

VISUAL BAR GRAPH of correct and incorrect answers using MATPLOTLIB MODULE.

Calculates Average Accuracy using the STATISTICS MODULE.

READING AND REVISION MODE::

A 5-step process:: SURVEY : Go through the chapter and write down your own notes. QUESTION : list questions about the topic. READ : read while keeping your questions in mind. RECITE : summarize what you've learned. REVIEW : revisit your notes and answers.

GRAPH VISUALISATION::

Displays a BAR CHART showing: Number of CORRECT ANSWERS Number of INCORRECT ANSWERS

USER FRIENDLY INTERACTION::

Simple and sorted interface. Clear instructions and guidance for each step. Infinite practice loops until the user chooses to stop.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED::

Tool OR Library Purpose random Randomizes flashcard order statistics Computes average accuracy matplotlib Generates bar graph for Accuracy visualization

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT::
.) Install Required Library: Only one external module is needed: install matplotlib

.) user has to clone or download the repository:

Save your project file (e.g., main.py) into a folder.

.) Run the Program Open a terminal OR cmd in the project folder and run: final main code.py

HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM:: .)When the program starts: You will be asked: Would you like to do flash cards or read a chapter? Type 'read' or 'flash'

.) Flashcard Mode:

Enter each question and its answer.
Press Enter on an empty question to finish.

THE PROGRAM FLOW:

Randomly show each question
Ask if you got it correct
Allow redo of incorrect questions
Show your score

Display a graph of your performance

READING MODE:

The program will make you go through you through: .)Surveying .) Generating questions .)Reading the chapter .)Reciting what you learned .) Reviewing notes

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:: To properly test the program: .)Flashcard Testing Try answering some correct, some incorrect Ensure redo prompts appear Verify scoring is accurate Graph Display Make sure matplotlib graph appears after flashcards Randomization Test Run multiple times and observe order changes
.)Statistics Test: Ensure average accuracy is printed correctly

.) Reading Mode Testing: Enter several notes/questions and verify they display correctly Walk through all 5 steps

.)Edge Case Testing: Enter zero flashcards Mark all answers wrong Mark all answers correct Choose to redo questions or skip redo Press Enter on all optional inputs
